	 * Entry point into the Nachos kernel. Called when a user program is

	 * arithmetic exception.
	 * 
	 * For system calls, the following is the calling convention:
	 * 
	 * system call code -- r2 arg1 -- r4 arg2 -- r5 arg3 -- r6 arg4 -- r7
	 * 
	 * The result of the system call, if any, must be put back into r2.
	 * 
	 * And don't forget to increment the pc before returning. (Or else you'll
	 * loop making the same system call forever!
	 * 
	 * @pWhich is the kind of exception. The list of possible exceptions are in
	 *         Machine.java
